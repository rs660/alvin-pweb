# Alvin's Personal Website

**Disclaimer**: Not fully updated. The website is completed, but I still need to fill out some more information and do more documentation on my projects before I release them on my portfolio.

This is a completely static website, featuring only (badly written) HTML and CSS. I would love to get better at making websites; however, I find backend much more interesting usually. Nonetheless, I will keep this site updated with new information about myself (yay, even more rambling).
