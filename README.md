# alvinhat's personal website (basically rambles)

This is a completely static website, featuring only (badly written) HTML and CSS. I would love to get better at making websites, but I cannot find any joy out of
front end no matter how much time I put into it; it is incredibly boring. Nonetheless, I will keep this site updated with new information about myself.
